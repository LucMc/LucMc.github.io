	body: `The CAV-Lab presentation at the University of Surrey captivated audiences with a demonstration of
			internally developed connected vehicle technology. The cars seen above have been designed, engioneered
			and programmed to operate through a WiFi connection.\n\n
			
			Through the use of a video feed, the operators were able to successfully navigate the university
			and communicate with spectators. This initial demonstration was an insight into the connected vehicle 
			research undergone in the lab. Future work will look at 4G connection to enable unbounded connections,
			furthermore the car is being fit with state-of-the-art object detection through the use of YOLO-v5. These
			advancements in vehicle technology lay the groundwork for autonomous research, as each car is equiped
			with a veriety of precise sensors designed to enable autonomous navigation.
